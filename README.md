**This program demonstrates how to implement a Logistic Regression model to classify flower species using the Iris dataset. It starts by loading the dataset and splitting it into training and testing sets. The features are then standardized using StandardScaler to ensure they have a consistent scale, which is important for Logistic Regression. The model is trained on the scaled training data and used to make predictions on the test set. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy (percentage of correct predictions) and the confusion matrix, which provides a detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect classifications. This workflow highlights key machine learning steps, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, offering insights into building and assessing a machine learning model using Logistic Regression.By following this workflow, the program not only provides hands-on experience with machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing and evaluation but also teaches how to implement and assess a machine learning model effectively.**
